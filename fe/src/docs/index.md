Index Supply's SQL API is a hosted HTTP API that allows you to run SQL queries on Ethereum Event Logs. Each query must also include a set of human readable ABI signatures _(ie `Transfer(from address, to address, tokens uint)`)_. This design allows you to query any event instantaneously and without pre-configuration!

You can use this API from your backend or from the browser.

Here is an example query

```
curl -G https://api.indexsupply.net/query \
    --data-urlencode 'query=select "from", "to", tokens from transfer limit 1' \
    --data-urlencode 'event_signatures=Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens)' \
    | jq .
```
And the response
```
{
  "block_height": 18479546,
  "result": [
    [
      [
        "from",
        "to",
        "tokens"
      ],
      [
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "0xdaabdaac8073a7dabdc96f6909e8476ab4001b34",
        "0"
      ]
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Chains {#chains}

Here are the currently supported chains. Each query must be run against a single chain and the chain is specified in the request params (instead of the query).

| Name                         | Id    |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Ethereum                     | 1     |
| Base                         | 8543  |
| Base Sepolia                 | 85432 |

## Queries {#queries}

The SQL API offers 3 basic types of queries: Single, Batch, and Live.

### Single {#queries-single}

A single query is executed against the latest state of the SQL API indexer.

### Batch {#queries-batch}

Batch queries are useful when you have several queries that you would like to run within the same database transaction. This allows you to get a consistent view of the chain across multiple queries. The response includes the block height at which the queries were run. You can use this value to start your live queries.

### Live {#queries-live}

A live query takes a query and a block height and will send HTTP SSE events as new events matching the query are indexed.

It is common to do a single (or batch) query on page load and then subscribe to updates once the page state has been initialized.

### Reorgs {#reorgs}

In the case of a chain reorg, clients will receive a block height that is lower than previously received. Clients should keep a single value pointer to the latest block height and when a new block is lower, the client should discard the entire state and start over. This should be fast, bug free, and consistent with crash-only software design principles!

## `GET  /query` {#get-query .reference }

### Request {#get-query-request}

```
GET /query?chain={}&sql={}&event_signatures={}
```

Query Parameters

- `chain`. See [chains](#chains) for possible values.
- `sql`. A SQL query referencing tables and columns from the `event_signatures`. See [SQL](#sql) for more details on the query language.
- `event_signatures`. A single [human readable event signature][3]

## `GET  /query-live` {#get-query-live .reference }

The request parameters for `/query-live` is identical to [`GET /query`](#get-query-request).

The response is a standard [response](#query-response) object but delivered via HTTP SSE. The SSE protocol will keep the connection open indefinitely and each new block will trigger a new event. Events are plain text, prefixed with `data: ` and separated by a `\n\n`.

### Request

```
GET /query-live?chain={}&sql={}&event_signatures={}
```

## `POST /query` {#post-query .reference }

### Request {#post-query-request .reference}
```
POST /query
[
  {
    "sql": "{}",
    "event_signatures": [
      "{}",
      "{}"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Response {#query-response .reference}

```
{
  block_height: {},
  result: [[[]]]
}
```

Regardless of the kind of query (ie get, post, single, batch) there is a single kind of response object returned. The response is JSON and includes the block height at which the query(s) were executed and a 3-dimensional array.

The first array dimension maps to the number of queries submitted. In the case of `GET/query` and `GET/query-live` this outer array will always have `length=1` (meaning the result is at: `result[0]`).

The second array dimension represents the number of rows returned from the query. This array can be empty (`length=0`) in the case that the query returned no rows.

If a query did return a set of rows, then the second array will always contain at least 2 items. The first is an array of the column names and the rest are arrays of column values.

The third array dimension represents column values. In the case of the column names, this will be an array of strings. In the case of column values, it will be an array with the following types:

All inner (3rd dimension) array will have the same length.


## SQL {#sql .reference}

The SQL API supports a subset of the Postgres SQL language. Here is a brief overview of the supported syntax:

```
SELECT select_list
FROM from_item
WHERE condition
GROUP BY grouping_column_reference [, 因
HAVING group_condition
LIMIT count
OFFSET start

where select_list is one of: *  | [[expression [AS output_name]], 因

  * Project all column references for all from_items

  [[expression [AS output_name]], 因

  Comma-separated list of value expressions. Value expression
  can be one of: column reference or aggregate function

  If a non-column-reference value expression is used in the select list,
  it conceptually adds a new virtual column to the returned table.
  The value expression is evaluated once for each result row, with the
  row's values substituted for any column references.

  If a column name reference is used and if more than one table
  has a column of the same name, the column name reference must
  be qualified with the table name. Eg table.column

where aggregate function can be one of:
  sum(), count(), avg(), min(), max()

where from_item can be one of:
  [[event_name [AS name]], 因

  [
      [event_name [AS name]]
      join_type from_item
      ON join_condition
  ]

  where event_name is an ascii string representing the
  name of the Ethereum Event. For example: "transfer" for
  `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens)`

  If more than one table is specified then the tables are CROSS JOIN-ed.
  A WHERE clause can be used to reduce the number of
  returned rows in the CROSS JOIN.

  where join_type is: { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] }

  where join_condition is a boolean expression

where group_column_reference is a column name reference

group_condition filters group rows created by GROUP BY

Expressions may include scalar sub-queries or table expression
sub-queries when combined with the EXISTS, NOT EXISTS,
IN, and NOT IN operators. Other operators include:

    ^
    *
    /
    %
    +
    -
    BETWEEN
    LIKE
    ILIKE
    <
    >
    =
    <=
    >=
    <>
    IS
    IS NULL
    IS NOT NULL
    NOT
    AND
    OR

```
